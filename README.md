## Project Description

In this internship project, I analyzed a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset using SQL and Python. The dataset included confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and geographic details across countries and provinces.

I performed data cleaning and preprocessing in Pandas (handling nulls, formatting dates) and loaded the data into SQLite for efficient querying. Using SQL, I extracted monthly and yearly summaries of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, identifying peak infection periods and regional trends.

Statistical analysis in Python included variance, standard deviation, and frequency calculations, providing insights into the spread, fluctuation, and patterns of the pandemic over time.

## Outcome

The project delivered a structured and cleaned dataset with clear insights into COVID-19’s progression during 2020–2021. Monthly and yearly trends revealed peak infection and recovery phases, while statistical metrics deepened the understanding of regional impacts.

This project showcased the effectiveness of combining SQL for querying with Python for advanced analytics, emphasizing the role of data analysis in public health decision-making.
